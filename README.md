# Transcriptomics-of-IgA-IgG-TIL-B

## Brief description
This repository contains code, tables and visualization for a paper soon to be published by Chudakov Lab. This work is focused on the study of tumour-infiltrating memory B cells and their influence on Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) progression

## Repository structure
**Bulk** folder contains scripts for downstream analysis of IgA+ vs IgG+ memory B cells in LUAD and KIRC. The bulk transcriptiome libraries were obtained in our laboratory and will be available after the release of an article. 

**Single-cell** folder contains scripts for clusterization and description of tumour-infiltrating memory B cells in LUAD. The single-cell transcriptome data was obtained from Leader et al. [article](https://github.com/effiken/Leader_et_al)

**TCGA** folder contains script for Kaplan-Meier curves representing the influence of absolute and normalized value of FCRL4 gene to the progression of LUAD.
