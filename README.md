# Comparative transcriptome analysis of B lymphocyte populations infiltrating tumors and expressing IgA and IgG

## Brief description
This repository contains code, tables, and visualizations for a paper soon to be published by Chudakov Lab. The research focuses on investigating the role of tumour-infiltrating memory B cells in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) progression. The findings shed light on the specific subset of FCRL4-expressing memory B cells, indicating exhausted, chronically antigen-stimulated phenotype.

## Repository structure
**Bulk** folder contains scripts for downstream analysis of IgA+ vs IgG+ memory B cells in LUAD and KIRC. The bulk transcriptome libraries obtained in our laboratory will be made available after the release of the associated article.

**Single-cell** folder contains scripts for clusterization and description of tumour-infiltrating memory B cells in LUAD. The single-cell transcriptome data was obtained from Leader et al. [article](https://github.com/effiken/Leader_et_al).

**TCGA** folder contains script for Kaplan-Meier curves representing the influence of absolute and normalized value of FCRL4 gene to the progression of LUAD.
